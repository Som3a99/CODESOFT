# Spam SMS Detection ðŸ“±

Spam SMS detection is a crucial task in ensuring the security and privacy of mobile users. This project aims to build an AI model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate. By leveraging techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings in conjunction with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines, we can effectively identify and filter out spam messages.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to distinguish between spam and legitimate SMS messages. Spam detection in SMS is essential for:

- Protecting users from malicious content
- Preventing scams and fraudulent activities
- Enhancing user experience and trust

---

## Dataset

We utilize a labeled dataset containing SMS messages categorized as spam or legitimate. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features from the text messages, including:

- Word frequencies
- Presence of specific keywords or patterns
- Length of the message

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is suitable for training the spam detection model.

## Approach

We explore various machine learning techniques, including:

- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines

These techniques are employed to transform the text data into numerical features and train a model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are utilized to optimize model performance and generalization.
