# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ”„

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for subscription-based services or businesses. This project aims to develop a model that predicts customer churn using historical customer data. By analyzing features such as usage behavior and customer demographics, we can anticipate which customers are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

---

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. Churn prediction helps businesses in:

- Identifying at-risk customers
- Implementing targeted retention strategies
- Maximizing customer lifetime value

---

## Dataset

We utilize historical customer data containing various features such as:
- Usage behavior (e.g., frequency of usage, duration of subscription)
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location)
- Subscription plan details

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is preprocessed for modeling purposes.

---

## Approach

We experiment with several machine learning algorithms including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting

These algorithms are trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict customer churn.

---

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to optimize model performance.
