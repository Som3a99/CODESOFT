# Movie Genre Classification Task

Welcome to the Movie Genre Classification Task within the CodeSoft Machine Learning Internship Program! üé¨

In this task, you'll create a machine learning model to predict movie genres based on plot summaries or other textual information. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines can be utilized.

## Objective

The objective of this task is to develop a model that accurately predicts the genre(s) of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual features. By successfully completing this task, you'll gain valuable experience in text classification and machine learning model development.

## Getting Started
