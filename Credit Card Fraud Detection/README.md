# Credit Card Fraud Detection Task

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection Task within the CodeSoft Machine Learning Internship Program! üí≥

In this task, you'll build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. You'll utilize a dataset containing information about credit card transactions and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Objective

The objective of this task is to develop a model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives. By successfully completing this task, you'll gain valuable experience in anomaly detection, imbalanced dataset handling, and machine learning model evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this task, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to Task Folder**: Navigate to the `Task2_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection` folder.
3. **Review Instructions**: Read the detailed instructions provided in the README file within the task folder.
4. **Explore Dataset**: Explore the dataset provided in the `data` folder. Understand the features and distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
5. **Choose Algorithms**: Choose algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests for building your fraud detection model.
6. **Preprocess Data**: Preprocess the dataset as necessary, including handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance.
7. **Develop Model**: Develop your fraud detection model using the chosen algorithms and evaluate its performance.
8. **Fine-tune Model**: Fine-tune hyperparameters and experiment with different techniques to improve model performance.
9. **Evaluate Performance**: Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate evaluation metrics, considering both accuracy and the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
10. **Document Results**: Document your findings, including model performance, key insights, and any challenges faced during the process.
