# Welcome to Codesoft ML Internship Projects Repository ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed during the Codesoft ML internship. Each project tackles a specific problem using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

---

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification ðŸŽ¬

Create a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines can be employed.

---

## Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information. Experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

---

## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ”„

Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Utilize historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and demographics, and apply algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

---

## Task 4: Spam SMS Detection ðŸ“±

Implement an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines can be utilized to identify spam messages.


**All datasets used in these tasks are sourced from Kaggle.**
